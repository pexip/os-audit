EXTRAOPTIONS=""

# This option is used to determine if rules & watches should be deleted on
# shutdown. This is beneficial in most cases so that a watch doesn't linger
# on a drive that is being unmounted. If set to no, it will NOT be cleaned up.
AUDITD_CLEAN_STOP="yes"

# This option determines whether the audit system should be disabled when
# the audit daemon is shutdown
AUDITD_STOP_DISABLE="no"

# This option determines whether or not to call augenrules to compile the
# audit rules from /etc/audit/rules.d. The default is "no" so that nothing
# happens to existing rules.
