About
=====
This is a GUI for configuring the Linux audit subsystem.

Installation
============

system-config-audit uses a separate program to access the configuration files
and apply the configuration.  It is installed in
$libexecdir/system-config-audit-server.  You need to use your distribution's
tools (e. g. consolehelper in Fedora) to run this program with necessary
privileges (usually as root).  Note that just making the program setuid is a
REALLY BAD idea, it would allow any user to modify the configuration.

For Fedora or RHEL, you can use (make install-fedora) instead of (make install)
to automate the above.

Bugs
====
Please report bugs to <mitr@redhat.com>.  Bug reports with patches are
especially welcome.
